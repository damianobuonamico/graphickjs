/**
 * This class is used to model the state of the stylus for a given position,
 * based on the state of the stylus at the original input points.
 *
 * The stylus is modeled by storing the last max_input_samples positions and
 * states received via Update(); when queried, it treats the stored positions as
 * a polyline, and finds the closest segment. The returned stylus state is a
 * linear interpolation between the states associated with the endpoints of the
 * segment, correcting angles to account for the "wraparound" that occurs at 0
 * and 2Ï€. The value used for interpolation is based on how far along the
 * segment the closest point lies.
 *
 * If Update() is called with a state in which a field (i.e. pressure, tilt, or
 * orientation) has a negative value (indicating no information), then the
 * results of Query() will be -1 for that field until Reset() is called. This is
 * tracked independently for each field; e.g., if you pass in tilt = -1, then
 * pressure and orientation will continue to be interpolated normally.
